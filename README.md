## 1. Overview and Origin

### Goal
* The idea of the project started with its founder’s main goal: to minimize operational risk and increase efficiency for post-trade procedures. 
* ICC TradeFlow is a blockchain platform designed to streamline trade processes for businesses, enabling businesses to visually map out trade flows, issue instructions to partners, and analyse trade actions in real time. In a single integrated environment, it allows businesses to manage their entire post trade process across multiple asset types. It provides sophisticated modeling solutions for trade capture, confirmation and settlement across industry standards.

### Founders
* Under the leadership of John Denton, the *International Chamber of Commerce ICC* joined *DBS Bank*, *Trafigure*, *Infocomm Media Development Authority IMDA*, *Enterprise Singapore*, and *Perlin* to launch **ICC Tradeflow** during the *World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos*; the first project built on the *TradeTrust* network.

### Funding
* TradeFlow's last funding type is *Seed*. 
>*Seed funding is the first official equity funding stage. It typically represents the first official money that a business venture or enterprise raises.* - Investopedia

## 2. Business Activities

### The Problem
* The securities industry worldwide is facing the challenge of dealing with higher volumes of trade and more complex asset classes as our changing world demands so. Trying to do this while keeping operational costs low can be difficult. TradeFlow's goal is to solve this by integrating post-trade operations complexity in a single platform.

### TradeFlow's Customers
* TradeFlow's main users are businesses involved in post-trade transactions or trade support middle office operations. Although I was not able to identify the specific companies that utilize TradeFlow, probably due to privacy and security measures, I myself am familiar with the use of it in the middle office trade support environment. It is used by brokers, custodians, and trade support employees all from different banks, funds, and firms actively trading shares on a daily basis.

### TradeFlow Technology and Key Features that Competitors Do Not Offer

* **A Scalable Business Model:** operational overheads increase as the scale of the projected industry increases in transaction volumes and asset class range. TradeFlow supports global expansion by enabling users to rapidly take on new instrument classes and clients. They also allow users to deliver excellent customer service by alerting the business when potential customer issues arise and accelerating information exchange with customers.

* **A Wide Range of Interfaces to Industry Utilities:** There is a back-end integration (inbound and outbound) with external systems. TradeFlow provides links to investment managers, brokers and custodians. It also contains fully integrated workflow interfaces with DTCC, SWIFT, Omgeo and MarkitSERV. In other words, TradeFlow integrates all the necessary tools for post-trade procedures, increasing efficiency. 

* **Minimized Operational Risk and Losses:** TradeFlow identifies risks early on the process, reducing losses and managing exceptions effectively.

* **Cross-Asset Class Capabilities:** TradeFlow enables access to equities, fixed income, FX and money market, OTC and exchange trade derivatives, and Repo and mutual funds.

* **Real time transactions:** The platform allows users to visualize trade flows and analyze trades in real time, cutting the end-to-end transit of documents which regularly takes between 20 to 45 days.

These features give businesses that utilize TradeFlow to manage post-trade procedures a noticeable competitive advantage in relation to those who do not.

## 3. Landscape:
*Financial Industry Domain: Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies*

### Major Industry Trends
* Over the last 5-10 years, the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Industry is focusing on platforms that can offer a unique combination of features to build enterprise level solutions.

#### The Blockchain Trilemma
* The Blockchain Trilemma refers to the trade off in any network between **scalability, decentralization** and **security**. Only two of these can succeed at the same time, at the expense of the third one (this is why it is a trilemma).

### TradeFlow's Competitors
* The digitization arms race between the Asian financial hubs, Hong Kong and Singapore, is making technology for financial markets more efficient, integrated and secure. Although similar initiatives, such as Hong Kong’s *eTradeConnect*, were built to achieve higher efficiency just like TradeFlow.

## 4. Results

### Business impact
* The business Impact of this platform has been a worldwide revolution on the post-trade processes delivered everywhere. The platform cuts end-to-end transit of documents which regularly takes between 20 to 45 days. Businesses that do not utilize TradeFlow for post-trade transaction quickly fall behind.

### Tradeflow's Metrics to Success
* TradeFlow's main metrics to success are scalability, efficiency and security. 
- **Scalability:** measured by the amount of trades done in the platform daily and if this average increases overtime.
- **Efficiency:** If the amount of trades done daily before market close increases with no holding user amount constant, we know that the efficiency of the post-trade procedure has increased, making it faster to reach trade settlement
- **Security:** Tradeflow must comply to different security measures such as SMPG. Failing to comply with these would result in trade failure. 
* TradeFlow is increasing on these success metrics, although in a continuously changing world, its ability to keep up with trade policies, amount and diversity of trades, and the combination of emerging post-trade platforms will define its future success in its field.

### Performance Relative to Competitors
* The main competitor advantage that TradeFlow has is that it was built to support incremental adoption globally as countries all over the world move towards digitization of trades. For instance, Hong Kong's *eTradeCommerce*, one of it's main competitors, does not fall behind under these success measures, but does not have the ability to keep up with future demands within these measure since it was not engineered to do so, which will ultimatey leave TradeFlow as the leading platform for post-trade procedures.

## 5. Recommendations

* I would suggest ICC to make TradeFlow compatible with as many other key digital blochain platforms as possible. ICC is working on building enterprise platforms that will be compatible with TradeFlow, such as ICC Clarify and E-Registry of Ships. 
        **ICC Clarify:** platform that values chain traceability and tracking
        **E-Registry of Ships:** digital vessel registration
However, I would advise to look forward to expanding the interfaces with key products even more, as trade transactions increase in complexity and scalability over time. 

* This will benefit TradeFlow users making it an essential platfrom to settle trades. The unique engineering of TradeFlow will allow it to lead the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Industry applied to the digitizing of the Trading process globally.

* Blockchain will allow to keep linking TradeFlow to different trade-support platforms that provide different information in order to settle trades.

* Blockchain is appropriate for this solution as it can be expanded and uniquely engineered to adapt to the changing Trading World.
